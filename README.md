# üõ£Ô∏è Toronto Traffic Congestion Analyzer
**Language:** Python  
**Libraries:** `pandas`, `plotly`, `geopandas`, `folium`, `requests`

---

## Overview
The **Toronto Traffic Congestion Analyzer** uses real open data from the [City of Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca) to visualize and analyze **traffic speed, volume, and congestion** patterns across the city.

It helps identify:
- Which hours of the day experience the worst traffic congestion  
- How congestion varies between weekdays and weekends  
- Which Toronto neighborhoods experience the highest congestion  

## üó∫Ô∏è Example Outputs
| Visualization | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| üïí Hourly Congestion Chart | Shows how congestion changes throughout the day. |
| üìÜ Heatmap (Weekday √ó Hour) | Displays patterns across the week. |
| üó∫Ô∏è Neighborhood Choropleth | Highlights which Toronto neighborhoods are most congested. |

## üìä Results

After analyzing over 1.2 million traffic speed records, I uncovered several key insights into Toronto's traffic congestion patterns:

### 1. Rush Hour Peaks (7‚Äì9 AM & 4‚Äì6 PM)
- Congestion was at its worst during typical commute times, with speeds often dropping below 25 km/h on major roads like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and near the Gardiner Expressway entrances.

### 2. Weekday vs. Weekend Patterns
- Weekdays showed sharp congestion spikes during morning and evening commutes.
- Weekends, on the other hand, had a much smoother overall flow, especially in suburban areas like Etobicoke and Scarborough, where average speeds stayed around 45‚Äì50 km/h throughout most of the day.
- Minor slowdowns occurred between 12 PM and 2 PM in Downtown and Midtown Toronto, with median speeds briefly dropping to 30‚Äì35 km/h
  
### 3. Neighbourhood Differences
- Central areas like Downtown, Waterfront, and Midtown experienced the heaviest congestion, while Etobicoke, Scarborough, and North York maintained faster speeds (often 40 km/h or higher).
- The choropleth maps made these differences easy to visualize, highlighting Toronto's downtown bottleneck problem.

### 4. Off-Peak Stability
- Late-night and early-morning traffic (roughly 10 PM‚Äì5 AM) was much smoother, with median speeds ranging from 45‚Äì55 km/h.

**Overall:** The project revealed that Toronto's traffic congestion isn't evenly spread out ‚Äî it's concentrated in the downtown core and during predictable rush hours. These findings suggest that policies like flexible work hours or better public transit coverage could meaningfully reduce peak-hour congestion.
