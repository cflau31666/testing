## Overview

The **Toronto Traffic Congestion Analyzer** uses real open data from the [City of Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca) to visualize and analyze **traffic speed, volume, and congestion** patterns across the city.

It helps identify:
- Which hours of the day experience the worst traffic congestion  
- How congestion varies between weekdays and weekends  
- Which Toronto neighborhoods experience the highest congestion  


## 🗺️ Example Outputs

| Visualization | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| 🕒 Hourly Congestion Chart | Shows how congestion changes throughout the day. |
| 📆 Heatmap (Weekday × Hour) | Displays patterns across the week. |
| 🗺️ Neighborhood Choropleth | Highlights which Toronto neighborhoods are most congested. |
