🛣️ Toronto Traffic Congestion Analyzer

Author: @cflau31666
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, plotly, geopandas, folium, requests

⸻

🚀 Overview

The Toronto Traffic Congestion Analyzer uses real open data from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal to visualize and analyze traffic speed, volume, and congestion patterns across the city.

It helps identify:
	•	Which hours of the day experience the worst traffic congestion
	•	How congestion varies between weekdays and weekends
	•	Which Toronto neighborhoods experience the highest congestion

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Data Source:
	•	The main dataset used is
Traffic Volumes - Midblock Vehicle Speed, Volume and Classification Counts
	•	This dataset includes vehicle counts, average speeds, and road segment coordinates.
	2.	Data Processing:
	•	Loaded and cleaned using pandas
	•	Aggregated hourly using groupby()
	•	Spatially joined with Toronto neighborhood polygons using GeoPandas
	3.	Visualizations:
	•	Hourly line plot of congestion levels
	•	Weekday vs. Hour heatmap
	•	Neighborhood-level congestion map (Folium)

🗺️ Example Outputs

Visualization	Description
🕒 Hourly Congestion Chart	Shows how congestion changes throughout the day.
📆 Heatmap (Weekday × Hour)	Displays patterns across the week.
🗺️ Neighborhood Choropleth	Highlights which Toronto neighborhoods are most congested.

⚙️ Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/cflau31666/toronto-traffic-congestion-analyzer.git
cd toronto-traffic-congestion-analyzer

2️⃣ Install dependencies

It’s best to create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt doesn’t exist, install manually:

pip install pandas plotly geopandas folium

3️⃣ Fetch the dataset

You can download the full CSV directly from the City of Toronto open data site,
or use the sample dataset provided:

# Sample dataset (small version for GitHub)
data/raw/sample_10k.csv

(Optional) To download the full dataset automatically:

python scripts/fetch_data.py


⸻

🧾 Outputs

After running:

python main.py

You’ll get:

File	Description
data/processed/neighbourhood_congestion.html	Interactive congestion map
data/processed/morning_congestion.html	Morning-hour map
data/processed/evening_congestion.html	Evening-hour map
data/processed/heatmap.html	Weekday × Hour heatmap


⸻

🧩 Tech Stack

Category	Tool
Data Handling	pandas
Visualization	Plotly, Folium
Geospatial Analysis	GeoPandas
Map Data	Toronto Open Data (GeoJSON)


⸻

⚠️ Notes
	•	Large raw data files (CSV & GeoJSON) are not included in the repository due to GitHub’s 25MB file limit.
	•	Use the provided script or link in this README to download them directly.
	•	Generated HTML files are saved locally under data/processed/.

⸻

📈 Future Improvements
	•	Integrate weather data to correlate congestion with rain/snow.
	•	Add a web dashboard using Streamlit.
	•	Implement time-series forecasting for traffic patterns.

Would you like me to include a small section for automatically downloading the dataset (a simple Python script like scripts/fetch_data.py)? It would make your repo look more polished and professional.
